% Instructions

Get a MQTT Broker running in your network (e.g. on the Raspberry Pi). Adjust the IP Adress (192.168.1.226) in RaspberryPi/DataCollector.py and Linksys\_Router/publish\_wifi\_clients.py to match the ip of the client that is running your MQTT broker.

Get yourself a Linksys WRT1900AC Router with openWRT operating system. The router needs to be in a network with the MQTT Broker and should be configured as an Access Point on your WLAN Devices. Edit the devices Dictionary in Linksys\_Router/publish\_wifi\_clients.py to match your personal Wifi devices and respective MAC-Addresses. Install Python, pip and the paho library on the router. Run the Linksys\_Router/publish\_wifi\_clients.py script on the Router.

Set up a phillips HUE in your network. Adjust RaspberryPI/LampControl.py to match your Hue's ip address.

Copy the RaspberryPI folder to your Raspberry Pi and run the DataCollector Script. This will store information about your lamps current status, daytime, connected devices, etc. in 'decision\_tree\_data' and 'raw' files. Let the data collection run for a few weeks.

After collecting data, run the RaspberryPi/ModelTrainer.py on your Raspberry. It will build a decision tree model based on the collected data stored in decision\_tree\_data.

Once the model is trained you can run RaspberryPI/Evaluator.py on your Raspberry. This script will switch the Hue on and off according to the decision tree model.
